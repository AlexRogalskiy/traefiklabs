# Traefik for Kubernetes Ingress: A Feature Study 

In words of “Traefik Community” itself:

> Traefik is the leading open source reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP and TCP-based applications that is easy, dynamic, automatic, fast, full-featured, production proven, provides metrics, and integrates with every major cluster technology.

Traefik is an open-source Edge Router that makes publishing our services an easy experience. It receives requests on behalf of our system and finds out which components are responsible for handling them.

### Traefik is an Edge Router

1) It means that it's the door to our platform.

2) It intercepts and routes every incoming request.

3) It knows all the logic and every rule that determines which service handles which requests, based on path, headers, host, etc.

## Traefik for Kubernetes

Traefik supports two ways for configuring access to a Kubernetes cluster:

1) KubernetesCRD (Custom Resource Definition)

2) Kubernetes Ingress Provider 

Out of the above, option 2 Kubernetes Ingress Provider is an Ingress Controller which we can utilise.

| Auto Service Discovery                             | When a service is deployed, Traefik detects it immediately and updates the routing rules in real time.<br><br>While deploying services, you attach information that tells Traefik the characteristics of the requests the services can handle. <br><br>Traefik is able to use your cluster API to discover the services and read the attached information.                                                                                                                         |
| Natively compliant with major cluster technologies | These include Kubernetes, Docker, Docker Swarm, AWS, Mesos, Marathon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Automatic Configurations                           | With Traefik, there is no need to maintain and synchronize a separate configuration file: everything happens automatically, in real time (no restarts, no connection interruptions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Dynamic Route Update                               | [ Existing infrastructure components like orchestrators, container engines, cloud providers, or key-value stores are called ‘providers’ in Traefik terminology.]<br><br>Traefik queries the providers' API in order to find relevant information about routing, and each time Traefik detects a change, it dynamically updates the routes.                                                                                                                                         |
| Auto Load Balancing                                | If more than one instances of a service is live, Traefik load balances the requests coming to these services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Minimises configuration reloads                    | Some providers may undergo a sudden burst of changes, which would generate a lot of configuration change events. This can trigger a lot of configuration reloads. <br><br>In order to mitigate this, a throttle duration can be provided. <br><br>Traefik waits for this duration after a configuration reload, before taking into account any new configuration refresh event. <br><br>If any event arrives during this duration, only the most recent one is taken into account. |
| Allows restricting of scope of service discovery   | For Kubernetes Ingress, Traefik allows putting constraints to disallow route creation for some services/pods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Allows HTTPS & TLS traffic                         | For obtaining TLS certificates, Traefik has good integration with Let's Encrypt (ACME).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Tweaking Requests before sending them to Services. | This is done using available ‘Middlewares’.<br><br>Request body length can be checked using the buffering middleware                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Security Middlewares                               | Requests can be passed to middlewares like BasicAuth, DigestAuth, IPWhiteList, RateLimit, etc. to carry out basic tasks of security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Allows limiting of simultaneous connections        | To proactively prevent services from being overwhelmed with high load, a limit on the number of simultaneous in-flight requests can be applied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Observability                                      | Traefik logs concern everything that happens to Traefik itself (startup, configuration, events, shutdown, and so on).<br><br>Access logs are also logged and we have options for formatting them in json, filtering them based on headers/names, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Metrics                                            | Traefik supports 4 metrics backends:<br>1. Datadog<br>2. InfluxDB<br>3. Prometheus<br>4.
